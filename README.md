# C-MongoDB-NodeJS
C#, MongoDB, NodeJS - Game Tracker

Using a combination of your favorite debugger (Cheat Engine, Ollydbg, Immunity, IDA, etc.), C#.net to read memory and write to a MongoDB server, and NodeJS to read from MongoDB.

Why? Just because, and I wanted a project to use these different technologies altogether.

You will need to install MongoDB packages via Nuget and NPM, as well as install MongoDB (obviously).
